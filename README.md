# Coding and data for the [article](https://sportsanalytics.berkeley.edu/articles/penalty-shootout.html) written for [Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley](https://sportsanalytics.berkeley.edu/)

The data for this article was taken from:

1. [World cup penalty shootouts | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pablollanderos33/world-cup-penalty-shootouts)
2. [Statsbomb open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)
3. [Api-football](https://www.api-football.com/) - I already collected the data from here as of Mid-March 2022, and put it into files to work offline. If you want the code of how I did it, contact me.

The data was processed to get it in the same form as in *1*.

|Game_id |   Team |   Zone |   Foot |   Keeper |   OnTarget |   Goal |   Penalty_Number |   Elimination |   Home |   Keeper_changed|
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |

*NOTE* You have to create an `images` directory in the main directory for the code to work.
